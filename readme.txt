Yes, an Asana account is required to use Completionist. You can quickly [create an Asana account](https://asana.com/create-account) for **FREE**!

= Are you affiliated with Asana? =

No, I do not have a business relationship with Asana. I just happened to be looking for an Asana integration for WordPress and failed to find an affordable, specialized solution. After noticing many others with the same problem, I decided to create Completionist!

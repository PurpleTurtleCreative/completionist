### [unreleased]

#### Added

- By popular demand, the first frontend feature is now implemented! The shortcode, `[ptc_asana_project]`, displays an Asana project in list layout.
- First custom REST API endpoint, `/v1/projects`, with the new Request Keys architecture to securely perform requests from the website's public frontend.
- Settings option to define which WordPress user's Asana connection should be used to authenticate frontend requests by default.
- Many new ReactJS components and styles to render the `[ptc_asana_project]` shortcode.

#### Fixed

- Duplicate display of a user listed in the plugin settings screen when their connected Asana account email does not match their WordPress user account email.
- Repeated authentication to the Asana API when using the currently logged-in user's identity. This fix improves performance and reduces API calls for connected Asana users in wp-admin.

### 3.3.0 - 2022-10-15

#### Added

- Pinned Tasks post editor metabox has been converted to ReactJS, offering a better experience, and is now directly integrated into the Block Editor as a plugin panel.
- Several new ReactJS components to compose the new Pinned Tasks plugin panel in the Block Editor.
- Task request errors are now elegantly displayed on the frontend for the Dashboard Widget and Pinned Tasks panel ReactJS components. Before, errors were only logged to the browser console or rarely displayed in a browser window alert.

#### Changed

- The original, jQuery-based Pinned Tasks metabox is now marked as existing only for backwards compatibility with WordPress's Classic Editor.
- The `ptc_create_task` AJAX action now returns the full Asana task object in `response.data` instead of the generated HTML representation.
- The `ptc_pin_task` AJAX action now returns the full Asana task object in `response.data` instead of just the task GID. This also helps ensure proper task visibility permissions are enforced.
- `Asana_Interface::maybe_get_task_data()` and `Asana_Interface::create_task()` now also include the task's `action_link` for frontend component compatibility.
- The ReactJS Pinned Tasks panel and Dashboard Widget styles are now imported as SCSS modules for automatic compiling and composition ease.

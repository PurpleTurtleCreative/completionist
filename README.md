Completionist is an integration WordPress plugin for Asana. It helps you establish a complete project management workflow between your Asana workspace and WordPress dashboard.

## Features

There are many ways to improve your productivity by using Completionist.

### Pinned Tasks

Pin an existing Asana task or create a new task right on relevant content in WordPress. You can pin tasks to content of any post type. Reduce frustrating context-switching by having all relevant tasks listed in one placeâ€”where the work needs to get done.

### Dashboard Widget

See task progress and quickly access all outstanding tasks on your WordPress dashboard. Upon logging in to your WordPress site, you'll know immediately what work needs to get done. If you have pinned tasks, you'll immediately be able to access the content with outstanding tasks. Filter tasks by *Pinned*, *General*, *Critical*, or *My Tasks*.

### Automated Tasks

Create Asana tasks automatically as events occur on your WordPress site to standardize task workflows. Set your own custom automation conditions, and compose tasks using dynamic merge fields. Standardize your processes, remove busy work, and never miss a beat.

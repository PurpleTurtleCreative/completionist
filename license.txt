I. Software Licensing
Software licenses are rewarded to Users upon purchase where the number of allowed Licensed Sites is determined by the specific product which was purchased as expressed in the product’s listing, cart entry, and order line-item details. Acquired Softwares are protected by U.S. copyright laws, and Users are granted the following Permissions for the number of rewarded licenses as expressed in our records. Users may review their rewarded licenses in the API Keys and API Downloads sections of their Purple Turtle Creative user accounts.

Permissions
Each rewarded license grants the owner with the following Permissions:

- DO use the Software on the number of licenses rewarded in your account. To see how many licenses you have been rewarded, see the API Keys tab in your Purple Turtle Creative account. Using the API Keys to activate a license on a website property helps Users keep track of their used versus rewarded licenses for the Software.
- DO modify the Software to suite your needs on Licensed Sites in ways that do not infringe on the Restrictions.
- DO share tips, tricks, tutorials, and code snippets that help other Users of the Software in ways that do not infringe on the Restrictions or help other Users infringe on the Restrictions in this Agreement.

Restrictions
Except for the aforementioned Permissions granted to license owners, license owners are limited by U.S. copyright laws of the Software, including the following Restrictions:

- DON’T redistribute or resell the Software under any circumstances that would infringe on U.S. copyright laws. The original author of the Software, Michelle Blanchette (also known as “Purple Turtle Creative”), retains copyright ownership of the Software and chooses to sell licenses to grant Users the aforementioned Permissions.
- DON’T use the Software on more website properties than the number of licenses rewarded to your Purple Turtle Creative account, shown in the API Keys tab of your Purple Turtle Creative account, or in purchase receipts where the Software line-item is in “good standing” (i.e. not removed, crossed out, or otherwise indicated as being revoked).
- DON’T alter the original author of the Software or claim the Software to be your or someone else’s own creation in a way that would infringe on U.S. copyright laws.
- DON’T attempt to transfer Software licenses. Software licenses are non-transferable and may only be used by the billed user. They may not be sold to other users of the license (such as clients) for commercial benefit. Additionally, the customer may not sublicense, to any person or entity, any rights to distribute the software or license key. Purple Turtle Creative will only provide support services to the original customer/license-holder with a legitimate license key, and consider any other uses of this license key for support queries as fraudulent.

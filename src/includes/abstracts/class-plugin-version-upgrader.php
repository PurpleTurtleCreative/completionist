			so the upgrade process should run again if the plugin is
			updated again in the future.

			EDGE CASE: This will not work for users who roll back to
			versions prior to v4.0.0. That's because this class
			was first introduced in v4.0.0, so the database option
			will remain set as '4.0.0' because this code doesn't exist
			in prior versions to fix the option value. Using such an
			old version of the plugin will also cause the uninstall
			script to be insufficient.

			If this causes issues, the user should simply uninstall
			the plugin (from the latest installed version, if possible)
			to completely remove all data and reset the plugin's state.
